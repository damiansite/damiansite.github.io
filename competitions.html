        <li>
          <strong>School Phase</strong>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li>This phase is organised by the school, from where only some of them are promoted to next phase. The number of people per class allowed to pass depends on the number of parallel classes (for example 11 "A", 11 "B" and 11 "C" would mean that only 3 people can go from 11-th class). The difficulty is varied depending on the teacher's selection of problems.</li>

          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li>This phase is organised by city administration. This phase is present only in cpaital, Chișinău due to the big number of participants. It's purpose is to filter and from around 100 students to get to best 25-30 students.
